- 👋 Hi, I’m @mwwagoner
- 👀 I’m interested in web development at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript and I'd like to pick up a Javascript framework of some sort, probably React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything related to web development that would give me some experience. At the moment I'm just working on a personal site to practice what I've learned.
